The Pact Broker is an application for sharing for Pact contracts and verification results.

## TL;DR

```console
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo add pact-broker https://pact-foundation.github.io/pact-broker-chart/

helm install pact-broker pact-broker/pact-broker
```

## Usage

The Pact Broker Chart is available in the following formats:
- [Chart Repository](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_repository/)
- [OCI Artifacts](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/registries/)

### Installing from Chart Repository

The following command can be used to add the chart repository:

```console
helm repo add pact-broker https://pact-foundation.github.io/pact-broker-chart/
```

Once the chart has been added, install one of the available charts:

```console
helm install pact-broker pact-broker/pact-broker
```

### Installing from an OCI Registry

Charts are also available in OCI format. The list of available charts can be found [here](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-broker-chart/).

Install one of the available charts:

```shell
helm upgrade -i <release_name> oci://ghcr.io/pact-foundation/pact-broker-chart/pact-broker --version=<version>
```

## Requirements

| Repository | Name | Version |
|------------|------|---------|
| oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts | common | 2.36.0 |

## Values

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| broker.affinity | object | `{}` | Pact Broker [Affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity) |
| broker.annotations | object | `{}` | Additional annotations that can be added to the Broker deployment |
| broker.config.allowDangerousContractModification | bool | `false` | Whether or not to allow the pact content for an existing consumer version to be modified. It is strongly recommended that this is set to false, as allowing modification makes the results of can-i-deploy unreliable. |
| broker.config.allowMissingMigrationFiles | bool | `true` | If true, will not raise an error if a database migration is recorded in the database that does not have an equivalent file in the codebase. If this is true, an older version of the code may be used with a newer version of the database, however, data integrity issues may occur. |
| broker.config.autoDetectMainBranch | bool | `true` | When true and a pacticipant version is created with a tag or a branch that matches one of the names in main_branch_candidates, the mainBranch property is set for that pacticipant if it is not already set. |
| broker.config.autoMigrateDb | bool | `true` | Whether or not to run the database schema migrations on start up. It is recommended to set this to true. |
| broker.config.autoMigrateDbData | bool | `true` | Whether or not to run the database data migrations on start up. It is recommended to set this to true. |
| broker.config.badgeProviderMode | string | `"redirect"` | The method by which the badges are generated. Allowed values: redirect, proxy |
| broker.config.baseUrl | string | `nil` | Base URL can be configured for architectures that use gateways or proxies that allow the same Pact Broker instance to be addressed with a different base URL.  The application may run correctly without this attribute, however, it is strongly recommended to set it when deploying the Pact Broker to production as it prevents cache poisoning security vulnerabilities. If you find that the URLs generated by the API are using an IP instead of a hostname, you can set this environment variable to force the desired base URL. Must include the port if it's a non-standard one. eg. https://my-broker:9292. Is not currently used for links in the UI. |
| broker.config.basicAuth.allowPublicRead | bool | `false` | Set to true if you want public read access, but still require credentials for writing.  |
| broker.config.basicAuth.enablePublicBadgeAccess | bool | `false` | Set this to true to allow status badges to be embedded in README files without requiring a hardcoded password. |
| broker.config.basicAuth.enabled | bool | `false` | Set to true if you basic authentication to be enabled  |
| broker.config.basicAuth.publicHeartbeat | bool | `true` | Set to true if you want the heartbeat endpoint to be publicly accessible. This will have to be true if you have enabled basic auth. |
| broker.config.basicAuth.readUser.existingSecret | string | `""` | Name of an existing Kubernetes secret containing credentials to access the Pact Broker |

| broker.config.basicAuth.writeUser.password | string | `""` | Password for write access to the Pact Broker |
| broker.config.basicAuth.writeUser.username | string | `""` | Username for write access to the Pact Broker |
| broker.config.checkForPotentialDuplicatePacticipantNames | bool | `true` | When a pact is published, the consumer, provider and consumer version resources are automatically created. To prevent a pacticipant (consumer or provider) being created multiple times with slightly different name variants (eg. FooBar/foo-bar/foo bar/Foo Bar Service), a check is performed to determine if a new pacticipant name is likely to be a duplicate of any existing applications. If it is deemed similar enough to an existing name, a 409 will be returned. |
| broker.config.createDeployedVersionsForTags | bool | `true` | When true and a tag is created, if there is an environment with the name of the newly created tag, a deployed version is also created for the pacticipant version. |

## Configuration and Installation Details

### Database Configuration

> **⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE in v4.0.0:** The bundled PostgreSQL subchart has been removed due to licensing changes. You must now provide your own PostgreSQL instance.

Starting with version 4.0.0, this Helm chart requires an external PostgreSQL database. You can use:
- Cloud-managed databases (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL)
- Self-hosted PostgreSQL instances
- Kubernetes operators (CloudNativePG, Zalando PostgreSQL Operator)
- Any PostgreSQL-compatible database

Configure the database connection by setting the following values:
- `database.host` - Database hostname or IP address
- `database.port` - Database port (defaults to 5432)
- `database.adapter` - Database adapter (defaults to "postgres", can also be "sqlite")
- `database.databaseName` - Name of the database

The credential configuration has two methods:

#### Specify Credentials via Values
Configure the Pact Broker by using the username credential that you configure via the `database.auth.username` value and the password via the `database.auth.password` value.
  > **_NOTE:_** Be careful and mindful that the values you provide here is done in a secure way.

#### Specify Credentials via Secret
Configure the Pact Broker to use an existing Secret to retrieve the user password as a means to connect to the database. Ensure that the Kubernetes Secret has the password in the `user-password` field and ensure that you have set `database.auth.existingSecret` value to the name of the secret. To configure the username, you can use the `username` value.

### Database Clean Task
Pact Broker [automatic data cleanup](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/docker_images/pactfoundation#automatic-data-clean-up) can be enabled by setting the property `broker.config.databaseClean.enabled` to `true`.

By default and for simple installations, one could rely on the built-in integrated mode of the cleanup (the property `broker.config.databaseClean.mode` having the value `embedded`).

For a more advanced setup e.g. in highly available installations with more than one replica, one should rely on the [external source pattern](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/docker_images/pactfoundation#running-the-clean-task-from-an-external-source) of running the clean task. That can be achieved by setting the property `broker.config.databaseClean.mode` to external, which would result in having a `CronJob` performing the cleanup task instead of the main application Pods.

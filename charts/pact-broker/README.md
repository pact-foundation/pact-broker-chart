The Pact Broker is an application for sharing for Pact contracts and verification results.

## TL;DR

```console
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo add pact-broker https://pact-foundation.github.io/pact-broker-chart/

helm install pact-broker pact-broker/pact-broker
```

## Usage

The Pact Broker Chart is available in the following formats:
- [Chart Repository](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_repository/)
- [OCI Artifacts](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/registries/)

### Installing from Chart Repository

The following command can be used to add the chart repository:

```console
helm repo add pact-broker https://pact-foundation.github.io/pact-broker-chart/
```

Once the chart has been added, install one of the available charts:

```console
helm install pact-broker pact-broker/pact-broker
```

### Installing from an OCI Registry

Charts are also available in OCI format. The list of available charts can be found [here](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-broker-chart/).

Install one of the available charts:

```shell
helm upgrade -i <release_name> oci://ghcr.io/pact-foundation/pact-broker-chart/pact-broker --version=<version>
```

## Values

| Key | Description | Type | Default |
|-----|-------------|------|---------|
| broker.affinity | Pact Broker [Affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity) | object | `{}` |
| broker.annotations | Additional annotations that can be added to the Broker deployment | object | `{}` |
| broker.config.allowDangerousContractModification | Whether or not to allow the pact content for an existing consumer version to be modified. It is strongly recommended that this is set to false, as allowing modification makes the results of can-i-deploy unreliable. | bool | `false` |
| broker.config.allowMissingMigrationFiles | If true, will not raise an error if a database migration is recorded in the database that does not have an equivalent file in the codebase. If this is true, an older version of the code may be used with a newer version of the database, however, data integrity issues may occur. | bool | `true` |
| broker.config.autoDetectMainBranch | When true and a pacticipant version is created with a tag or a branch that matches one of the names in main_branch_candidates, the mainBranch property is set for that pacticipant if it is not already set. | bool | `true` |
| broker.config.autoMigrateDb | Whether or not to run the database schema migrations on start up. It is recommended to set this to true. | bool | `true` |
| broker.config.autoMigrateDbData | Whether or not to run the database data migrations on start up. It is recommended to set this to true. | bool | `true` |
| broker.config.badgeProviderMode | The method by which the badges are generated. Allowed values: redirect, proxy | string | `"redirect"` |
| broker.config.baseUrl | Base URL can be configured for architectures that use gateways or proxies that allow the same Pact Broker instance to be addressed with a different base URL.  The application may run correctly without this attribute, however, it is strongly recommended to set it when deploying the Pact Broker to production as it prevents cache poisoning security vulnerabilities. If you find that the URLs generated by the API are using an IP instead of a hostname, you can set this environment variable to force the desired base URL. Must include the port if it's a non-standard one. eg. https://my-broker:9292. Is not currently used for links in the UI. | string | `nil` |
| broker.config.basicAuth.allowPublicRead | Set to true if you want public read access, but still require credentials for writing.  | bool | `false` |

| broker.config.basicAuth.writeUser.username | Username for write access to the Pact Broker | string | `""` |
| broker.config.checkForPotentialDuplicatePacticipantNames | When a pact is published, the consumer, provider and consumer version resources are automatically created. To prevent a pacticipant (consumer or provider) being created multiple times with slightly different name variants (eg. FooBar/foo-bar/foo bar/Foo Bar Service), a check is performed to determine if a new pacticipant name is likely to be a duplicate of any existing applications. If it is deemed similar enough to an existing name, a 409 will be returned. | bool | `true` |

## Configuration and Installation Details

### Configuring Chart PostgreSQL

With the Pact Broker Helm Chart, it bundles together the Pact Broker and a Bitnami PostgreSQL database - this can be enabled by switching `postgresql.enabled` to true (it is `true` by default). If switched on, the Helm Chart, on deployment, will automatically deploy a PostgreSQL instance and configure it with the credentials you specify. There are multiple ways of doing this that will be detailed below.

#### Automatic Database Credential Creation
This is the easiest of the configuration options. Here, the credentials for both the Admin and Database user will be automatically generated and put into a Kubernetes secret. This then will be automatically used by the Pact Broker. For this, ensure the following happens:
  - Keep `postgresql.auth.existingSecret` & `postgresql.auth.password` empty.

#### Specifying Password for PostgreSQL to Use
Here, you can specify the password that you want PostgreSQL to use for it's Database User (The user that the Pact Broker will use to connect to the database). For this, ensure the following happens:
  - Keep the `postgresql.auth.existingSecret` empty.
  - Set the `postgresql.auth.password` to the value that you want the User password to be.
  > **_NOTE:_** Be careful and mindful that the value you provide here is done in a secure way.

#### Specifying Existing Secret for PostgreSQL to Use
Here, you can specify an existing Kubernetes secret that you have created that contains the Password that you want PostgreSQL to use. The secret has to be in the same namespace as where you are deploying the Helm Chart. For this, ensure the following happens:
  - Create the Kubernetes secret with the Password inside.
  - Set `postgresql.auth.existingSecret` to the name of the Secret
  - PostgreSQL by default will look for the relevant Password keys that are set by default here `postgresql.auth.secretKeys`. So make sure that the Keys in the Secret match the default `secretKeys` values. More information [here](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/postgresql)
  - For example, if you want PostgreSQL to use an existing Secret called `my-user-secret` that has the User password that you want to use inside it. Make sure that you create a Key inside that secret called `user-password` (this key can be found here `postgresql.auth.secretKeys.userPasswordKey`). i.e. `user-password=Password123`.

### Configuring External Database
If you want to use an external database with your Pact Broker, switch the `externalDatabase.enabled` flag to true and the `postgresql.enabled` to false.

The configuring of the `externalDatabase.config.host`, `externalDatabase.config.port`, `externalDatabase.config.adapter` and `externalDatabase.config.databaseName` should be pretty straight forward. The credential configuration however has two methods of configuration.

#### Specify Credentials via Values
Configure the Pact Broker by using the username credential that you configure via the `externalDatabase.config.auth.username` value and the password via the `externalDatabase.config.auth.password` value.
  > **_NOTE:_** Be careful and mindful that the values you provide here is done in a secure way.

#### Specify Credentials via Secret
Configure the Pact Broker to use an existing Secret to retrieve the user password as a means to connect to the database. Ensure that the Kubernetes Secret has the password in the `user-password` field and ensure that you have set `externalDatabase.config.auth.existingSecret` value to the name of the secret. To configure the username, you can use the `username` value.

### Database Clean Task
Pact Broker [automatic data cleanup](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/docker_images/pactfoundation#automatic-data-clean-up) can be enabled by setting the property `broker.config.databaseClean.enabled` to `true`.

By default and for simple installations, one could rely on the built-in integrated mode of the cleanup (the property `broker.config.databaseClean.mode` having the value `embedded`).

For a more advanced setup e.g. in highly available installations with more than one replica, one should rely on the [external source pattern](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/docker_images/pactfoundation#running-the-clean-task-from-an-external-source) of running the clean task. That can be achieved by setting the property `broker.config.databaseClean.mode` to external, which would result in having a `CronJob` performing the cleanup task instead of the main application Pods.
